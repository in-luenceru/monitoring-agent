# Wazuh User/Group Bypass Solution

## Overview

This solution bypasses the hardcoded "wazuh" user and group requirements in Wazuh agent binaries without requiring system-level user creation or binary modification.

## How It Works

### Linux/Unix Implementation (LD_PRELOAD)

The bypass uses the `LD_PRELOAD` mechanism to intercept system library calls:

1. **Function Interception**: When Wazuh binaries call `getpwnam("wazuh")`, our library intercepts it
2. **Conditional Redirection**: Returns fake user/group data for "wazuh" requests
3. **Passthrough**: All other user/group lookups are forwarded to the original system functions

### Technical Details

**Intercepted Functions:**
- `getpwnam()` - User lookup by name
- `getgrnam()` - Group lookup by name
- `getpwnam_r()` - Thread-safe user lookup
- `getgrnam_r()` - Thread-safe group lookup
- `getpwuid()` - User lookup by UID
- `getgrgid()` - Group lookup by GID

**Fake User/Group Data:**
- Username: "monitoring" (mapped from "wazuh")
- UID/GID: Current user's UID/GID
- Home Directory: Agent installation directory
- Shell: /bin/bash

## Integration

### Automatic Activation

The bypass is automatically enabled in both control scripts:

**Linux (`monitoring-agent-control.sh`):**
```bash
# Auto-enable bypass if library exists
if [[ -f "$BYPASS_LIB" && -z "${LD_PRELOAD:-}" ]]; then
    export LD_PRELOAD="$BYPASS_LIB"
fi
```

**Windows (`monitoring-agent-control.ps1`):**
```powershell
# Auto-enable bypass for Windows if DLL exists
if (Test-Path $script:BYPASS_DLL) {
    Initialize-WazuhBypass
}
```

### Manual Control

You can disable the bypass by setting an environment variable:
```bash
export DISABLE_WAZUH_BYPASS=1
./monitoring-agent-control.sh start
```

## Security Analysis

### ‚úÖ Advantages

1. **Non-Invasive**: No system modifications required
2. **Reversible**: Easily disabled by removing LD_PRELOAD
3. **Process-Scoped**: Only affects the specific agent processes
4. **Clean**: No binary patching or recompilation
5. **Auditable**: Source code is transparent and reviewable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

1. **Platform Specific**: LD_PRELOAD is Unix/Linux only
2. **Environment Dependent**: Can be cleared by system policies
3. **Process Inheritance**: Child processes inherit the bypass
4. **Debug Complexity**: May complicate troubleshooting

### üîí Security Impact

- **Low Risk**: Only intercepts user/group lookups for "wazuh"
- **Contained**: Cannot affect other system operations
- **Transparent**: Does not hide from process monitoring
- **Auditable**: Easy to detect and verify

## Platform Support

### Linux/Unix ‚úÖ
- **Method**: LD_PRELOAD shared library
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested
- **Files**: `bypass.c` ‚Üí `bypass.so`

### Windows ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Method**: DLL injection (planned)
- **Status**: Framework implemented, injection pending
- **Files**: `bypass_windows.c` ‚Üí `bypass_windows.dll`
- **Note**: Requires advanced DLL injection techniques

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Library Not Found**
   ```bash
   # Check if bypass library exists
   ls -la /workspaces/monitoring-agent/bypass.so
   ```

2. **Permissions Issues**
   ```bash
   # Ensure library is executable
   chmod +x /workspaces/monitoring-agent/bypass.so
   ```

3. **Environment Reset**
   ```bash
   # Manually set LD_PRELOAD if needed
   export LD_PRELOAD=/workspaces/monitoring-agent/bypass.so
   ```

### Verification

Test that bypass is working:
```bash
# Should return fake "monitoring" user data
LD_PRELOAD=/workspaces/monitoring-agent/bypass.so getent passwd wazuh
```

Expected output:
```
monitoring:x:1000:1000:Monitoring User:/workspaces/monitoring-agent:/bin/bash
```

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Only affects user/group lookups
- **Cached**: Results are cached within the library
- **Efficient**: Direct function calls, no system overhead

## Maintenance

### Updates
- Recompile after system library updates
- Test after glibc upgrades
- Verify compatibility with new Wazuh versions

### Monitoring
- Check library loading in process maps: `cat /proc/PID/maps | grep bypass`
- Monitor for LD_PRELOAD environment variable
- Verify agent functionality remains intact

## Alternative Approaches (Not Implemented)

1. **Binary Patching**: Direct modification of executable files (risky)
2. **System User Creation**: Creating actual "wazuh" user/group (against requirements)
3. **Container Isolation**: Running in isolated container environment
4. **Source Compilation**: Modifying and recompiling Wazuh source (complex)

## Conclusion

The LD_PRELOAD bypass solution provides a clean, secure, and maintainable way to run Wazuh agents without requiring dedicated system users. It's particularly suitable for environments where system-level modifications are restricted or undesirable.

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Safe to use in production** with proper monitoring and testing.
